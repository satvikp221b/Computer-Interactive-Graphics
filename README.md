# Computer Interactive Graphics Projects

This repository contains a collection of assignments completed for the **Computer Interactive Graphics class** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)**. Each project focuses on different aspects of computer graphics, from basic animation to terrain generation, physics-based simulations, and ray tracing.

Wherever possible, I have included working links to the HTML version of each project for easy access.

## Projects Structure

### 1. **Dancing Illinois Logo and Similar Animations**
   **Directory**: `UIUC logo and other animations/`  
   **Description**: This project features an animation of the Illinois logo, combined with other 2D animations such as rotating cubes and psychedelic patterns. It focuses on using WebGL for rendering and user input through radio buttons to switch between animations.

### 2. **Terrain Generation and Torus**
   **Directory**: `Terrain/`  
   **Description**: A project centered on the generation of fractal terrain using the faulting method. It also includes a customizable torus model where users can control the number of rings, points per ring, and torus puffiness.

### 3. **Camera and Vehicle Movement on Terrain**
   **Directory**: `Terrain-Flight/`  
   **Description**: This assignment extends the terrain generation project with camera controls and vehicular movement. Users can toggle between flight mode and ground movement, while the camera adjusts smoothly to the terrainâ€™s height.

### 4. **Spheres and Fireworks Simulation**
   **Directory**: `Spheres and Fireworks/`  
   **Description**: This project simulates spheres inside a bounding box, with physics-based interactions such as sphere collisions, variable mass, and radii. Additionally, a fireworks simulation was implemented with glowing particles and additive blending to simulate explosions.

### 5. **Raytracer**
   **Directory**: `Raytracer/`  
   **Description**: A raytracing project that renders 3D imagery by calculating the intersection of rays with spheres and planes. It supports multiple light sources, textures, shadows, and advanced camera effects like fisheye, panorama, and depth of field.
