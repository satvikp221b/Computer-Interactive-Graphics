For this assignment, I had to submit a webpage with one canvas that includes an animation of the University of Illinois logo, alongside additional animations selectable via radio buttons. All animations are 2D. The submission had to include an HTML file and any number of accompanying JavaScript, CSS, GLSL, and JSON files, with no image files allowed.

The required components include a layout with proper HTML structure (DOCTYPE, lang, charset, title), at least one script in the head, and a canvas element. 

The animations will include the University of Illinois logo, which will move, rotate, or change size in a smooth manner, and a different animation will appear when another radio button is selected.

Animations that i submitted include:
- Dancing Logo 
- Rotating Cube
- Psychedelic effects
- Collision detection
- Mouse Movement interaction
- Stickman animation.
